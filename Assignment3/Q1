
var number = 2;
function Square (n) {
    var res = n * n;
    return res;
}
var newNumber = Square(3);
In the above JavaScript code, there are two variables named number and newNumber and one function named Square which is returning the square of the number. So when we run this program, Global Execution Context is created.

So, in the Memory Allocation phase, the memory will be allocated for these variables and functions like this.

                                        Golbal Execution Context

                Memory Components                   |                  Code Components
                                                    |
            number : undefined                      |
            Square : function Square(number){       |
                let res = num * num;                |
                return res;                         |
            }                                       |
            newNumber : undefined;                  |

In the Code Execution Phase, JavaScript being a single thread language again runs through the code line by line and updates the values of function and variables which are stored in the Memory Allocation Phase in the Memory Component.

So in the code execution phase, whenever a new function is called, a new Execution Context is created. So, every time a function is invoked in the Code Component, a new Execution Context is created inside the previous global execution context. 


                                        Golbal Execution Context
                
                Memory Components                   |                   Code Components
                                                    |
            number : undefined                      |    Memory Components        |         Code Components
                                                    |                             |
            Square : function Square(number){       |   n : undefined             |
                let res = num * num;                |   res : undefined           |
                return res;                         |
            }                                       |
            newNumber : undefined;                  |

So again, before the memory allocation is completed in the Memory Component of the new Execution Context. Then, in the Code Execution Phase of the newly created Execution Context, the global Execution Context will look like the following.

                                        Golbal Execution Context
                Memory Components                   |                   Code Components
                                                    |
            number : undefined                      |    Memory Components        |         Code Components
                                                    |                             |
            Square : function Square(number){       |   n : 2                     |         num * num
                let res = num * num;                |   res : 4                   |
                return res;                         |
            }                                       |
            newNumber : 4;                  |

As we can see, the values are assigned in the memory component after executing the code line by line, i.e. number: 2, res: 4, newNumber: 4.

After the return statement of the invoked function, the returned value is assigned in place of undefined in the memory allocation of the previous execution context. After returning the value, the new execution context (temporary) gets completely deleted. Whenever the execution encounters the return statement, It gives the control back to the execution context where the function was invoked.

                                    Golbal Execution Context
                Memory Components                   |                   Code Components
                                                    |
            number : undefined                      |   
                                                    |                            
            Square : function Square(number){       |   
                let res = num * num;                |   
                return res;                         |
            }                                       |
            newNumber : 4;                          |

After executing the first function call when we call the function again, JavaScript creates again another temporary context where the same procedure repeats accordingly (memory execution and code execution). In the end, the global execution context gets deleted just like child execution contexts. The whole execution context for the instance of that function will be deleted

Call Stack: When a program starts execution JavaScript pushes the whole program as global context into a stack which is known as Call Stack and continues execution. Whenever JavaScript executes a new context and just follows the same process and pushes to the stack. When the context finishes, JavaScript just pops the top of the stack accordingly.
                                    

                                        Execution Context 2


                                        Execution Context 1


                                        Global Execution Context


Call Stack

When JavaScript completes the execution of the entire code, the Global Execution Context gets deleted and popped out from the Call Stack making the Call stack empty.
