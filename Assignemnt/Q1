    Position Static -
        HTML elements are positioned static by default.

        Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

        An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:-
        
        This <div> element has position: static;

        its CSS -:

                            div.static {
                                 position: static;
                                 border: 3px solid #73AD21;
                            }

    Position Fixed - 
        An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

        A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

        its CSS -

                            div.fixed {
                                position: fixed;
                                bottom: 0;
                                right: 0;
                                width: 300px;
                                border: 3px solid #73AD21;
                            }   

    Position Absolute -
        An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

        However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

        its Css - 
                        div.absolute {
                              position: absolute;
                              top: 80px;
                              right: 0;
                              width: 200px;
                              height: 100px;
                              border: 3px solid #73AD21;
                        }

    Position Relative - 
        An element with position: Relative; is positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed.

        However; if an Relative positioned element has positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with ancestors.

        its CSS -
                        div.relative {
                             position: relative;
                             width: 400px;
                             height: 200px;
                             border: 3px solid #73AD21;
                        }

    Position sticky - 
        An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

        A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).

        its CSS Code Example - 
                        div.sticky {
                             position: sticky;
                             top: 0;
                             background-color: green;
                             border: 2px solid #4CAF50;
                        }
